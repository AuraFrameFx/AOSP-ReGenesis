Policy: Java/Kotlin toolchains
- Primary target: Java 24, Kotlin 2.2.
- Temporary exception: Build-logic and daemon use Java 21 due to current JDK 24 provisioning issues; revert when upstream is fixed.
- Consistency rule: jvmTarget must not exceed targetCompatibility.
- Use Kotlin DSL (Gradle) across modules.
